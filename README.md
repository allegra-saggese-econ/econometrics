## First Year sequence: econometrics
- [x] Quarter 1: Probability theory, random variables, distributions and their properties, principles of data reduction
- [ ] Quarter 2: FGLS, GLS, OLS, 2SLS, asymptotics, hypothesis testing, standard errors
- [ ] Quarter 3: TBD

### Purpose
These notes provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of key material covered in the first-year PhD econometric sequence at UCSC. Notes are adapted
from both lectures held at UCSC during the 2024-25 term, and include all topics covered in the first year econometrics sequence. They include theorems, definitions, proofs, explanations, examples, and problem sets to aid understanding and application.

### Textbooks
(1) George Casella and Roger Lee Berger - Statistical Inference (Volume 1, Volume 2) 
(2) Joshua D. Angrist and JÃ¶rn-Steffen Pischke - Mostly Harmless Economics (focus for clustered standard errors) 
(3) Russel Davidson and James G. MacKinnon - Econometric Theory and Methods
(4) Fumio Hayashi - Econometrics


### Use Cases
- *PhD students*: Core reference for probability theory and econometric methods to supplement your own, or cross-check your own course learnings. Note we have a strong focus on method of moments estimators, GMM and GLS in the first year sequence.
- *Undergrad/MSc students*: Overview of key topics covered in a first year PhD sequence to benchmark existing learning against.
- *Researchers & Instructors*: Teaching and review resource to share. 

### Key Topics Covered
- Probability theory
- Transformations, expectations, distributions (including conditional) and their properties
- Random variables, samples and properties, and how to reduce data with statistics
- Hypothesis testing
- Fundamental estimators and methods: FGLS, GLS, OLS, 2SLS 
- Point estimation
